To configure and compile: 

1.go to cmake_build directory:

cd cmake_build

2.edit CMakeLists.txt to set the paths for cuba, gtests and lhapdf

nano ../src.CMakeLists.txt

2. run cmake on src/CMakeLists.txt to configure

cmake ../src/

3. compile with 

make


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running guidelines:

1. edit the runcard

The runcard is a file called (by default) "runcard" in the directory cmake_build.
To change the filename you have to run 

./ehixs --input_filename myfilename

In the runcard any line starting with # is a comment. All other lines have to
have the structure:

parameter = value

A list of available parameters, along with some explanation is provided with 

ehixs --help

All these parameters can be set in the runcard (or in command line, which 
overwrites the runcard), and can be used to define a single run (i.e. one sector)
or a set of sectors. 

ehixs --info 

gives a list of the sectors that fit the selection criteria of the runcard

2. Add cuts or histograms in the runcard 

The structure is 

histogram = [histogram_name, number_of_bins, lowend, highend]

cut = [cut_name, value1, value2,...]

To see what histograms and cuts are defined for your process run 

./ehixs --histogram_info

./ehixs --cut_info

In order to add new cuts you need to 
(a) define them: edit the file in user_src/subprocess/subprocess_cuts.h
where subprocess is the production or decay mode the cut is for. 
For example, to add a new cut at the WW/ZZ decay mode you need to edit 
user_src/WWZZ_decay/decay_WWZZ_cuts.h

(b) add them as available cuts: edit the file 
user_src/subprocess/subprocess_cut_initialization.h

where you have to set a default value for your cut.

3. Run the code 
Here you have two options 
a) single sector run: 

./ehixs -s XX    

where XX is your sector number (it needs to be a number from 0 to N in the set
 defined by the runcard criteria - you can see that set with ./ehixs --info).
 
b) all runs with the python script:
The script (run_all_sectors.py) is found in cmake_build. In the first few lines
there is a variable "directory_name" which you should edit. This directory 
(which will be created if it doesn't exist already) will contain all the result 
files for the run, all the log files (the vegas output and all single sector 
ehixs output) and a file containing information on how many and which sectors 
were run (in xml form). 

After editing the directory_name variable in the python script you can run

run_all_sectors.py
 
4. read the results  (currently in standard output)

They consist of a table with lines like 

 35 |  -1.33e-03 |   1.02e-04 |     7.7% |    49995 |    41.08s | 8.22e-04s/point

where the numbers are :

sector id # | signa | error | error% | #of points | cpu time needed | cpu time/point

Then there is the total xsection with its error, the probability that the error 
is wrong for the most problematic sector, together with its id number, and then
 information about the histograms that were requested in runcard.

You can rerun the run_all_sectors.py script as many times as you like (e.g. 
to redirect the output): the script will not run sectors for which the ouput 
file already exists!

We have to think about whether this is a good strategy!
